# RedM Documentation

This documentation is organized for a practical RedM server workflow: ship features safely, keep resources maintainable, and onboard contributors fast.

## Start Here

1. Read [Installation](/docs/getting-started) and complete the setup checklist.
2. Use [Script Basics](/docs/scripting) for code organization rules.
3. Define contracts using [Events](/docs/scripting/events) and [Commands](/docs/scripting/commands).
4. Keep packages clean with [Resource Guide](/docs/resources) and [Folder Structure](/docs/resources/structure).
5. Ship with confidence using the [Deploy Checklist](/docs/resources/deploy).

## Documentation Standards

- Every page should answer one operational question.
- Every code sample should be copy-pastable.
- Every feature-level change should update docs in the same pull request.

## Team Workflow

- Keep a single source of truth for naming conventions.
- Treat events as contracts, not implementation details.
- Prefer short runbooks over long narrative docs.
