# Installation

Use this page to prepare a new developer machine in less than 30 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- RedM server artifacts installed and runnable
- Access to the server repository and resource packages
- A staging environment for verification before production

## Local Setup Checklist

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start docs locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Validate production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Confirm your local RedM resource startup order matches staging.

## First Day Outcomes

- You can run docs and inspect all routes.
- You can update one docs page and verify the build.
- You can identify where events, commands, and resource manifests live.

## Recommended Repo Hygiene

- Use predictable folder names for resources and shared packages.
- Keep environment variables documented in one place.
- Link each docs page to the folder or script it describes.
