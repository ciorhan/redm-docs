# Resource Guide

Resource structure should support fast onboarding and safe scaling.

## Core Principles

- Separate shared utilities from feature resources.
- Keep dependencies explicit in `fxmanifest.lua`.
- Version config changes with migration notes.
- Prefer small focused resources over large monoliths.

## Resource Lifecycle

1. Design: define ownership, events, and commands.
2. Build: implement server/client/shared modules.
3. Validate: run local smoke checks and staging scenarios.
4. Deploy: roll out with a rollback plan.

## Team Conventions

- Every resource must include a short README with purpose and dependencies.
- Every resource should have one owner or owning team.
- Every breaking change must include upgrade instructions.
