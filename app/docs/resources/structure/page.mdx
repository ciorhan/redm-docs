# Folder Structure

Use a structure that maps directly to ownership and runtime concerns.

```text
resources/
  core/
    identity/
    permissions/
    inventory/
  gameplay/
    jobs/
    economy/
    missions/
  ui/
    hud/
    menus/
  tools/
    admin/
    diagnostics/
```

## Inside A Single Resource

```text
jobs/
  fxmanifest.lua
  README.md
  server/
    main.lua
    events.lua
    commands.lua
  client/
    main.lua
    ui.lua
  shared/
    config.lua
    constants.lua
```

## Structure Rules

- Group by gameplay domain first, technology second.
- Keep `shared/` deterministic and side-effect free.
- Keep command and event handlers in dedicated files.
- Document non-obvious startup dependencies in README.
