# Deploy Checklist

Use this runbook before every production release.

## Pre-Deploy

- Run lint and type checks.
- Build docs and confirm no route regressions.
- Validate server startup logs in staging.
- Verify critical events and admin commands manually.

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Release Gate

- Confirm resource version tags are updated.
- Confirm migration notes for config/data changes.
- Confirm rollback bundle is ready.
- Confirm on-call operator is available during rollout.

## Post-Deploy Verification

- Monitor startup and runtime errors for 15-30 minutes.
- Smoke test login, inventory, jobs, and economy flows.
- Confirm command responses for operational tools.

## Rollback Plan

1. Stop impacted resources.
2. Restore last-known-good bundle.
3. Restart with previous manifest versions.
4. Log incident notes and root-cause actions.
