# Commands

Use commands for operational tools and admin workflows.

## Guidelines

- Include permission checks
- Return clear messages for failure states
- Keep side effects obvious in command naming

## Example

```lua
RegisterCommand("reload_jobs", function(source)
  if source ~= 0 then return end
  print("Jobs reloaded")
end, true)
```
