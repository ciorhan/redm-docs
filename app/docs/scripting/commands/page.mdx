# Commands

Use commands for operator workflows, diagnostics, and controlled maintenance.

## Command Design Rules

- Command names should be action-based and explicit.
- Validate source and permissions before work.
- Return actionable feedback for success and failure.
- Keep dangerous operations server-console only.

## Safe Admin Command Example

```lua
RegisterCommand("reload_jobs", function(source, args)
  if source ~= 0 then
    print("[reload_jobs] denied: command is console only")
    return
  end

  local targetJob = args[1] or "all"
  print(("[reload_jobs] reloading %s"):format(targetJob))
  -- reload logic here
end, true)
```

## Suggested Categories

- `reload_*`: reconfigure or refresh resources
- `debug_*`: diagnostics with clear output
- `admin_*`: operational tools restricted to trusted roles

## Checklist Before Adding A Command

- Does it duplicate existing behavior?
- Is permission handling strict enough?
- Is output clear for logs and operators?
