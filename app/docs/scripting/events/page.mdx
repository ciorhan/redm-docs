# Events

Design events as explicit contracts between server and client.

## Rules

- Validate payloads on server side
- Keep event arguments small and typed
- Log failed validations with context

## Pattern

```lua
RegisterNetEvent("job:start", function(jobId)
  if type(jobId) ~= "string" then return end
  -- continue
end)
```
