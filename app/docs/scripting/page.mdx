# Script Basics

Design scripts for long-term maintenance, not quick patches.

## Rules

- One resource module should own one feature boundary.
- Keep event names explicit: `<domain>:<action>`.
- Never mutate player or world state without validation.
- Keep server authority for critical gameplay logic.

## Suggested Script Layout

```text
resources/
  gameplay/
    jobs/
      fxmanifest.lua
      server/
        main.lua
        handlers.lua
      client/
        main.lua
      shared/
        config.lua
```

## Baseline Pattern

```lua
local RESOURCE = "jobs"

RegisterNetEvent(RESOURCE .. ":openMenu", function()
  local src = source
  if src == nil then return end
  print(("Open menu requested by %s"):format(src))
end)
```

## Quality Gates

- No global mutable state without clear ownership.
- No silent returns for invalid state: log context for operators.
- All exported functions should include input expectations.
