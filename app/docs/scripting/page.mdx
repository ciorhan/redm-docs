# Script Basics

Use one responsibility per script module and keep event names explicit.

## Naming

- Prefer feature-based folders
- Use stable event prefixes
- Keep command names short and unique

## Example

```lua
RegisterNetEvent("inventory:open", function()
  print("Open inventory requested")
end)
```
